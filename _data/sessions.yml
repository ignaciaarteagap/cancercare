  title: "Keynote: Participating in Personalisation: recrafting values in UK cancer care"
  description: "It has seemed as though research and care in cancer services can be readily distinguished through regularly updated ethical guidelines, practical procedures, job roles, funding and patient interests. Social as well as health scientists may address research and care separately. For example, ethnographers have drawn attention to the (unpaid) clinical labour that patients dedicate to research, but I wonder whether care also demands this labour. Developments in personalised medicine provide us with the opportunity to reconsider values in cancer care and, focusing on the logic of 'participation', I discuss a form of labour that is critical to developments in molecular biology, data science, research design and NHS improvements."
