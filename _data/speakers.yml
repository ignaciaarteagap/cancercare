Kirsten has numerous publications to her name, which include her book, published last year entitled: 'Health and Other Unassailable Values: Reconfigurations of Health, Evidence and Ethics'. A very engaging read which sets out to examine health as a core cultural concept, unpacking contemporary conceptions of health and the transformations in how we understand it, assess it and enact it. Kirsten's other publications include 'Communicating evidence: Lifestyle cancer and the promise of a disease-free future'; 'The breast-cancer-ization of cancer survivorship: Implications for experiences of the disease'; and 'Biomarkers, the molecular gaze and the transformation of cancer survivorship'."
