#### The Abstract Deadline has been Extended

Due to strike action across British universities, the deadline of the call for abstract proposals has been extended until 23rd March 2018.

If you are a researcher using ethnographic methods to understand any aspect of cancer care  in the UK, we encourage you to [submit an abstract]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/call-for-papers) for the morning  workshop. We have now secured a bursary to assist with the travel and accommodation costs of the presenters!
